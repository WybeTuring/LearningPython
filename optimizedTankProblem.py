# Intent: This is an implementation that determines the number of litres that a given tank can contain. Tanks are passed in as arrays. For examples, the tank A = {2,0,2} can hold two litres
#         of water. The tank B = {3,0,2,5,4,7} can hold a total of


# This function calculates the total number of litres a tank of a certain nature may have. The tank must be structures in a way that prohibits a an element lower than the first
# Examples include {3, 0, 0, 4, 6, 7}, {7,3,4}, {2, 0, 2}
